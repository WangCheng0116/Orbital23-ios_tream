#Motivation

The world is a vast and fascinating place, filled with countless destinations to explore and experiences to be had. However, planning a trip can be a daunting task, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the location they wish to visit. This is where an itinerary app comes in handy.

The motivation behind developing an itinerary app is to simplify the travel planning process and enhance the overall travel experience. By providing a platform where users can easily plan and organize their trips, an itinerary app can save travelers time, money, and the stress that often comes with planning a trip.

With an itinerary app, users can browse through a wide range of destinations, activities, and accommodation options, and customize their itinerary according to their preferences and budget. 

Apart from that, an expense tracker is integrated into this application. The expense tracker can be designed to be user-friendly, allowing travelers to easily track their expenses and categorize them into different categories, such as transportation, accommodation, food, and activities. This can help users get a clear overview of their spending and identify areas where they may need to cut back.

In conclusion, an itinerary app is a valuable tool for modern-day travelers. By simplifying the travel planning process, providing useful information, and tracking spending along the trip, it can enhance the overall travel experience and help travelers make the most out of their trip.

#Scope of Project

iTravel is a mobile application developed on iOS platforms and serves as an application for itinerary planning, expense management and document saving. We plan to use Xcode for development of the software, firebase as the database of the software, and Sketch for interface design. These IDEs or tools come with powerful functionalities that can greatly boost our development. 

To ensure that the itinerary, document and expense data associated with the user is correctly stored and readily available when it is called, we employed an authentication system that requires users to sign in to use iTravel.

Inside the App, users can navigate through different features using the navigation bar at the bottom of the page, including viewing itineraries, adding itineraries, saving documents, managing expenses, as well as the setting page. These pages will be elaborated in the following “Features” section.


#Features

Login system

iTravel is designed to be used upon user sign in. We plan to use Firebase as the database and authentication provider. iTravel is planned to support email and Google authentication methods.

Current Progress: We have created the Login Page, however, due to region constraints, we encountered problems setting up Firebase SDKs and thus we have yet to connect to Firebase.



Viewing Itineraries

We plan to include a page where users can view the current itineraries in list form, and if we have time, we would incorporate the map feature with the itineraries as well. That is, users can also view their activities from the map. We aim to achieve this feature using the google Map API.

Current Progress: We have yet to implement the viewing feature for milestone 1.




Adding Itineraries

We plan to include a page where users can create itineraries in list form, and if we have time, we would incorporate the map feature with the itineraries as well to better facilitate visualization of itineraries. We aim to achieve this feature using the google Map API.

Current Progress: We have yet to implement the adding feature for milestone 1.

Saving Documents

We plan to include a page where users can take photos of their important documents, or import images from the gallery. The users can thus retrieve the important documents where necessary. We plan to implement this feature using the UI image feature within the Xcode IDE.

Current Progress: We have yet to implement the documentation feature for milestone 1.



Checking Expenses

We plan to include a page where users can log their daily expenses and view the total expenditure. The users can view the trip expenses and check expenses based on different categories.

Current Progress: We have yet to implement the expenses feature for milestone 1.


Setting Page

We plan to include a page where users can change currencies due to international travels, and can submit feedbacks. 

Current Progress: We have implemented the change currency feature but yet to implement other functionalities for milestone 1.
